Dataset
This data set includes information about individual rides made in Ford bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area in Februrary 2019. First of all, the data was assessed to identify quality and tidyness issues, after which, these issues were addressed in the cleaning session, After cleaning, the dataset consisted of 171,305 rows and 19 columns. The data was then explored and visualisations were made to create insights.

Summary of Findings
Duration by minutes had its highest frequency at 8 minutes, week started and week ended showed that most bike rides happend on mondays to fridays. Subsribers were higher bike users than customers. Male gender were more prominent in the that female gender in the bike rides. Both the hour started and hour ended showed that most rides started and ended within the same time being 8am and 5pm.

Key Insights for Presentation
For the presentation, I looked at User_type, member_gender, average duration_by_minutes, week and hour started and ended and how they interact with each other. First of all, a countplot was created to ascertain the frequency of the variables, after which the bivariate and univariate relationships were examined across variables to draw insights while harnessing histograms, pie charts, bar charts, scatterplots, violin plots, box plots, line plots etc.
